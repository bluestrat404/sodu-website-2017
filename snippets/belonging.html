<h2>SoDu Weekenders</h2>
<p>The first step to joining our church family is to attend a SoDu New Member Weekender, where you’ll enjoy discover the history, mission, and vision of South Durham Church, meet our leaders, and learn what we mean by membership. Weekenders are held every other month over a Friday night dinner and Saturday morning breakfast.<p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<h3>We exist to make disciples of Jesus Christ to the glory of God through God-centered worship, gospel-driven discipleship, and grace-filled mission.</h3>
<p>Our mission is the same mission that Jesus called his followers to in the Bible:</p>
<blockquote>“Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” —Jesus, Matthew 28:18–20</blockquote>
<p>Jesus gave this command to his followers right before he ascended into heaven. Today, the church carries out this mission though the gathering of believers in worship, teaching, obedience to Christ, and sharing the good news about him with others.</p>

<h2>Our Church Covenant</h2>
<p>A church covenant is a list of biblical commitments our members make to one other. We invite you to come be a part of how the Lord is making us into the image of Jesus, together.</p>
<blockquote><p>Believing that the Spirit of God has brought us to repent of our sins and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and having been baptized upon our profession of faith in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, we do now, relying on His gracious aid, solemnly and joyfully renew our covenant with one another as one body in Christ:</p><p>We will walk together in a manner worthy of the Lord, one body, as commanded in Scripture, affectionately caring for one another, watching over each other, and faithfully encouraging, admonishing, and pleading with one another in obedience to the Spirit.</p><p>We will faithfully assemble together, grow in fellowship with one another, pray for, and serve one another, always working together to sustain the church’s worship, discipline, and doctrines.</p><p>We will endeavor, by loving and consistent discipleship, to present one another and those under our care mature in Christ before God.</p><p>We will rejoice at each other’s happiness and bear each other’s burdens and sorrows with tenderness and sympathy.</p><p>We will strive for the unity of this church, being slow to anger, slow to speak, and quick to listen, slow to take offense, and quick to reconcile and forgive as instructed by our Lord.</p><p>We will pursue spiritual growth through regular Bible reading and prayer, ever reminding ourselves of the saving grace of God and our assurance of being his adopted children.</p><p>We will seek, by the Holy Spirit’s aid, to live carefully in the world, denying all ungodliness and worldly lusts. We will strive to walk in the good works prepared beforehand by God for us, thereby glorifying God, imitating Christ, and pleasing the Holy Spirit.</p><p>We will labor for the salvation of the lost, praying for them, building relationships with them, and sharing the gospel with them at each opportunity, hoping always in the wisdom, love, and power of God.</p><p>We will welcome, test by the Scriptures, and submit ourselves to the instruction of the elders and teachers, even as we lift up our leaders in prayer before the Lord.</p><p>We will devote our time and abilities for the good of the church, and we will contribute cheerfully, regularly, and sacrificially to the support of the ministry, the expenses of the church, the relief of the poor, and the spread of the gospel through all nations.</p><p>We will, when we move from this place, notify this congregation and covenant with another church faithful to the principles of God’s Word.</p></blockquote>
