<h3>Why We Give</h3>
<blockquote>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich. –The Apostle Paul, 2 Corinthians 8:9</blockquote>
<p>Christians are infinitely wealthy in Christ, and everything we have in this world belongs to God. Faith in Christ’s sacrificial gift on our behalf frees us to be both generous and joyful, having a healthy attitude toward our material possessions.</p>
<p>One of our core values at South Durham is gospel-driven discipleship. Regular giving is one element of discipleship, helping to free us from the love of money even as we get the joy of participating in God’s mission through giving to his church.</p>

<h3>Stewardship</h3><p>One word the Bible uses for Christians is “steward”. A steward is a person who manages something that belongs to someone else, in accordance with the owner’s will.</p><p>Christians are to steward the gospel message (1 Corinthians 4:1-2) as well as their own talents and gifts (1 Peter 4:10). The Bible tells us, “You are not your own, for you were bought with a price,” the price of God’s own Son (1 Corinthians 6:19-20; Romans 8:32).</p><p>In recognizing this, we see that nothing we have is ours, but all belongs to Christ. Therefore, we are stewards of the financial resources God has entrusted to each of us.</p><p>At South Durham Church, we desire to help every disciple grow in his or her understanding of the theology of money and practical ways of stewarding financial resources well.</p>

<h3>Common Questions About Giving</h3>
<h4>How much should I give?</h4><p>The Old Testament teaches that God’s people were to give 10% for the support of the ministry and the relief of the poor. In the New Testament, God’s people are taught to give “according to their means…and beyond their means, of their own accord” (2 Corinthians 8:3).</p><p>We teach all members to set 10% of income as a recommended minimum goal for their regular offerings, and to give above and beyond that as God leads and as gives them joy.</p>
<h4>Should I give all of my offerings to South Durham Church?</h4><p>If you consider South Durham Church to be your church home, we suggest that at least 10% of your income be given to South Durham Church. The reason is that in the New Testament, the examples we see of giving all happen in the context of a local church. In addition, the church is the only non-profit organization that consistently sends money out to other organizations (see more below).</p><p>Each act of giving is an act of worship to God. Allocate your money, therefore, in response to God’s grace, in prayer, and in the accountability of other Christians you trust.</p>
<h4>What is the spiritual purpose of generosity in financial giving?</h4><p>Generous, cheerful giving, done in faith, increases our faith, our joy, and our righteousness. Jesus taught, “Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also” (Matthew 6:21).</p><p>Giving back to God from what He has given us moves our heart toward Him and His mission in the world. In doing so, we “lay up for [ourselves] treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal” (Matthew 6:20).</p><p>We are constantly tempted to worship money. In it, we look for security, peace, and hope. Generous financial giving to God’s church helps to free us from idolatry and fix our eyes on Christ.</p>
<h4>What if I can’t give 10% right now?</h4><p>There are times when giving 10% is truly not feasible. We would encourage you to set a lower goal for regular giving with an eye toward moving up to 10% as you are able. Generous giving is sacrificial and costly, and regular giving requires good planning so that we can meet all of our other obligations.</p>
<h4>How will my gift be used?</h4><p>At South Durham, we strive for financial transparency. At each quarterly member meeting, we present a financial report to the congregation showing budgeted and actual expenses in each budget category. For a copy of the most recent report, please contact <a href="mailto:april@southdurham.org">our bookkeeper</a>.</p><p>Ten percent of all gifts given to the South Durham general budget are sent out to local, national, and international missions, so a minimum of 10% of each gift to South Durham goes out for ministry beyond our church.</p>
