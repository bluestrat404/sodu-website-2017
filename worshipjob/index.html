						<h2>The Role</h2>
						<p>We're looking for a godly man who loves leading people in the musical worship of Jesus Christ. The right candidate will be passionate about the Lord and about developing people for ministry. He'll be a self-starter and constant learner when it comes to his craft, whether he leads from guitar, keys, or an organ. And he can expect to be poured into and cheered on by a pastor who understands the unique challanges of leading worship from personal experience.</p>
						<p>This is a part-time paid position. The candidate must be available for the equivalent of one day (planning and discipling) and one evening (rehearsal) during the week in addition to leading on Sunday mornings.</p>

								<h3>Our Mission Field</h3>

							<p>Southern Durham, North Carolina, is in one of the fastest growing regions in the country. It is uniquely diverse, with no majority ethnic group (45% African American, 43% Caucasian) and large south Asian and Middle Eastern populations. By day, it's a thriving shopping hub for the Triangle. By night, it's home to families connected to Duke, UNC, Research Triangle Park, and downtown Durham businesses.</p>

								<h3>Core Values</h3>

							<p><strong>God-Centered Worship:</strong> God is worthy of all of our worship and all of our praise, on Sundays and throughout the week.</p>
							<p><strong>Gospel-Driven Discipleship:</strong> The gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ, is not only the way a person becomes a Christian; it's also how Christians grow in holiness.</p>
							<p><strong>Grace-Filled Mission:</strong> God has lavished his grace on us in Christ so that we would extend his grace to others in gospel proclamation and service.</p>
